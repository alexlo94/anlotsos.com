    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The Dyatlov Files was the pilot product of Unseen Media and was developed during the NYC Media Lab XR Startup
        Bootcamp. It was an immersive tabletop mystery game that aimed to deliver the experience of an escape room,
        right in the comfort of our players' living rooms. The story of The Dyatlov Files is our interpretation of the
        popular conspiracy theories surrounding the Dyatlov Pass Incident, a mysterious and tragic cold case that dates
        back to 1959 Soviet Russia.</p>
    <p>The game had three distinct components that were integral to the core gameplay experience: physical documents, a
        companion AR app used to examine the physical documents, and various websites that had been set up as part of
        the game. The game borrowed heavily from established ARG (Alternate Reality Game) tropes to create an immersive
        universe that blurred the lines of fiction and reality.</p>

    <h2>The Plot</h2>
    <p>In the Dyatlov Pass Incident, 9 young hikers died due to "an unknown compelling force". The 10th member of the
        group, Yuri, had stayed behind at a checkpoint because he felt "too ill to handle the trek". The investigation
        was suspiciously short and not thorough, leaving Yuri dissatisfied with the explanation of his friend's untimely
        deaths. Over the years, Yuri continued his private investigation of the incident hoping to find a more
        satisfying explanation. He has found several pieces of evidence that hint towards the involvement of university
        higher-ups, government agencies, and even the military! Unfortunately, Yuri passed before he could complete his
        investigation and all of his research is in your hands.</p>

    <h2>How It's Played</h2>
    <p>After ordering the game, players would receive a shipment of evidence containing autopsy reports, classified
        government documents, and personal correspondence related to the Dyatlov Pass Incident. The documents would
        contain puzzles that our players would have to solve using teamwork, wits, and our companion AR app.</p>
    <p>The AR app was built in Unity3D and used ARCore to provide our players with a suite of investigative tools that
        helped them uncover the answers to various puzzles. For example, players could use a facial recognition camera
        utility that would detect any persons of interest that were related to top-secret Soviet government cases. Use
        the camera utility on pictures found inside the initial evidence packet, as well as pictures found online was
        the key to unlocking a large portion of the game's narrative. Other utilities included an image reconstruction
        utility to rebuild corrupted images, and a Geiger counter to detect radioactivity in physical objects.</p>
    <p>The objective of the game is for the players to solve all the puzzles in their way and piece together their
        conclusion about what happened in the Dyatlov Pass Incident and submit their report to find out the truth. Once
        the player had solved the Dyatlov Files mystery they would be eligible to tackle other cold cases that were
        planned for further releases in the series.</p>
