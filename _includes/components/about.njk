                        {# <p>I am a web developer and creative technologist based in New York, NY who enjoys thinking out of
                            the box and coding up creative solutions to
                            a variety of problems. I have an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Philosophy from Boston
                            University where I also minored in computer science, and hold a master's degree in Integrated
                            Digital Media from New York University.

                        <p>Shortly after graduating from NYU, I founded <a href="https://www.unseenmedia.io/"
                                class="inline">Unseen Media</a> alongside

                            we set out to bring the latest immersive technologies to tabletop gaming. Our journey was quite
                            interesting, starting with our participation in the <a

                            As the lead developer at Unseen Media, I try to walk the cutting edge of tech as often as
                            possible while always learning and looking for ways to grow as a professional. Because of our
                            mission to level up tabletop gaming, my skill set is wide and varied but here are
                            some of the technologies I've been working with most recently:

                            Hello there! My name is Alexandros (Alex) and I’m currently a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://csls.sesp.northwestern.edu/" class = "inline">Northwestern’s Computer Science and Learning Science</a> program. I work with professor Mike Horn at the <a href="https://tidal.northwestern.edu/">TIDAL Lab</a> and my research is focused on HCI and interaction design education, as well as the design of (sometimes playful) learning environments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Philosophy from Boston University and I hold a master’s degree in <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/integrated-design-media-ms" class = "inline">Integrated Design and Media</a> from New York University. Before coming to Northwestern to pursue my Ph.D., I held an adjunct faculty position at NYU and I was part of the New York City startup scene where my co-founders and I worked to bring the latest immersive technologies to tabletop gaming.
