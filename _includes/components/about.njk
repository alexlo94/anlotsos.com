                        <p>I am a web developer and creative technologist based in New York, NY who enjoys thinking out of
                            the box and coding up creative solutions to
                            a variety of problems. I have an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Philosophy from Boston
                            University where I also minored in computer science, and hold a master's degree in Integrated
                            Digital Media from New York University.

                        <p>Shortly after graduating from NYU, I founded <a href="https://www.unseenmedia.io/"
                                class="inline">Unseen Media</a> alongside
                            <a href="https://www.caseyjudge.com/" class="inline">Casey Judge</a> and <a
                                href="https://www.brianhui.me/" class="inline">Brian Hui</a> and
                            we set out to bring the latest immersive technologies to tabletop gaming. Our journey was quite
                            interesting, starting with our participation in the <a

                                Bootcamp</a>, later resulting in our selection for the RLab Beta Residency, and our
                            partnership with

                            As the lead developer at Unseen Media, I try to walk the cutting edge of tech as often as
                            possible while always learning and looking for ways to grow as a professional. Because of our
                            mission to level up tabletop gaming, my skill set is wide and varied but here are
                            some of the technologies I've been working with most recently:
